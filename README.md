**Functional Interface:**

-> It is also called as SAM(Single Abstract Method) interface

-> Interface can also declare the abstract methods from the java.lang.Object class, but still the interface can be called as a functional interface.

-> If you add another abstract method to the interface the compiler will throw error on your face directly.

-> We can extend an interface from another functional interface.

-> List of functional interfaces are given in java.util.functions

-> Filtering - Predicate functional interface

-> Action - Consumer functional interface


**Lambda Expression**

-> Functional programming. 

-> A function can be created without belonging to any class.


**Type Inference**

-> Inference is a Java Compilers ability to look each method invocation and corresponding declaration to determine the type argument(or arguments) that make the invocation applicable.

**Internal Iterators**


-> Controlled by JVM executed parallelly in the different cpu's.

-> Eg: forEach() (lambda) or (method reference)


**Lambda Method Reference**
