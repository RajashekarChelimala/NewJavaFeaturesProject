**Functional Interface:**

-> It is also called as SAM(Single Abstract Method) interface

-> Interface can also declare the abstract methods from the java.lang.Object class, but still the interface can be called as a functional interface.

-> If you add another abstract method to the interface the compiler will through error on your face directly.

-> We can extend an interface from another functional interface.

-> List of functional interfaces are given in java.util.functions
